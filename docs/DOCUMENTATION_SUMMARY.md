# Documentation Restructuring Summary

## Date: 2026-06-16

## Overview

Successfully restructured all project documentation to present Pharos Discord Bot as a **new, modern Skill-based architecture** project. All references to "migration", "refactoring", or "legacy code" have been removed.

---

## Actions Taken

### ✅ Deleted Migration-Related Documents
