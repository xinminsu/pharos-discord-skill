## 🏗️ Architecture

This project uses a **Skill-based architecture** where each feature is an independent module:

```
src/
├── core/SkillManager.ts    # Central orchestrator
├── skills/                 # Feature modules
│   ├── balance/           # Balance queries
│   ├── gas/               # Gas operations
│   ├── alert/             # Event monitoring
│   └── push/              # Message pushing
└── services/web3Service.ts # Blockchain layer
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Modular and extensible
- ✅ Easy to maintain
- ✅ Simple to add new features
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
