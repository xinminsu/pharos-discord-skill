# Bot Test Report

## Test Date: 2026-06-17

## Overview
Successfully started and verified Pharos Discord Bot with Skill-based architecture.

---

## ✅ Startup Test Results

### Initial Issue (Fixed)
**Problem**: Login failed with "Used disallowed intents" error  
**Cause**: Requested `MessageContent` and `GuildMessages` intents that weren't enabled in Discord Developer Portal  
**Solution**: Removed unnecessary intents, kept only `Guilds` which is sufficient for slash commands  

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Before (caused error)
intents: [
  GatewayIntentBits.Guilds,
  GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages,
  GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent,
]

// After (working)
intents: [
  GatewayIntentBits.Guilds,
]
```

## 🧪 Next Testing Steps

### Manual Testing Required

To fully verify functionality, test these commands in Discord:

#### 1. Balance Query
```
/balance address:0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb
```
**Expected**: Returns ETH balance from Pharos network

#### 2. Token Balance
```
/balance address:0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb token:0xTokenAddress
```
**Expected**: Returns ERC20 token balance

#### 3. Gas Price
```
/gas-price
```
**Expected**: Shows current gas prices on Pharos

#### 4. Gas Estimate
```
/gas-estimate from:0xSender... to:0xReceiver... value:0.1
```
**Expected**: Estimates transaction fees

#### 5. Alert Management
```
/alert add type:custom message:"Test alert"
/alert list
/alert remove id:alert_xxx
```
**Expected**: Creates, lists, and removes alerts

#### 6. Push Message
```
/push message:"Test notification"
```
**Expected**: Sends formatted message to channel

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Current Server Count: 0
The bot shows "Currently serving 0 servers" because it hasn't been invited to any Discord server yet.

**To Fix:**
1. Use this invite link (replace CLIENT_ID):
   ```
   https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1516606258101092474&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands
   ```
2. Select your Discord server
3. Authorize the bot
4. Commands will appear after a few minutes

### Deprecation Warning
```
DeprecationWarning: The ready event has been renamed to clientReady
```
This is a minor warning from discord.js v14. The bot works correctly. Can be fixed by changing:
```typescript
client.once('ready', ...) → client.once('clientReady', ...)
```
